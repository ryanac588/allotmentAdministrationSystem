# allotmentAdministrationSystem
My final project for university.

Having identified the administration of allotment plots as a process which would benefit 
from digital transformation, I proceeded to investigate the current procedures, design a
software solution, implement the solution, and perform basic user acceptance testing on it.

The first implementation, submitted for my final assessment for university, is contained 
within this repository.
